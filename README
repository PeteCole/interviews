# October 2010 - Coding task

In [NHS Evidence](http://www.evidence.nhs.uk, "NHS Evidence homepage"), we interface with a Fast search engine. This indexes content to provide relevant search results to a query. One aspect of indexing is [stemming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming,  "Article on Stemming via wikipedia.org").  The following task demonstrates how stemming can influence the indexing process.

Please look at the following class stub and acceptance criteria notes:

    public class Documents
    {
        const string gibberish1 = @"Friends are friendlier friendlies that are friendly and classify the friendly classification class. Flowery flowers flow through following the flower flows";

        /*
        * Acceptance criteria
        * 
        * frequency("following")                - 1
        * frequency("flow")                     - 2
        * frequency("classification")           - 1
        * frequency("class")                    - 1
        * frequency("flower")                   - 3
        * frequency("friend")                   - 4
        * frequency("friendly")                 - 4
        * frequency("classes")                  - 1
        * 
        */
    }

Please write code to process the string `gibberish1` to determine the frequency of the stemmed word given in the acceptance criteria.  It should take around two hours.

## The rules

* Don't use stemming libraries, your code only has to satisfy the acceptance criteria
* Use any language you are comfortable with, prefer c# or ruby
* Demonstrate the acceptance criteria with discrete tests

Please submit code to edward.hiley-at-nice.org.uk by Wednesday 3rd November, or put on [github](http://github.com) and email the repository url.
